Distracto will be a todo list that serves only a few simple purposes:
 - It asks what your goals are today
 - It allows you to enter a list of objectives
 - It allows you to mark objectives as completed
 - It allows you to edit entries in the list


Implementation details:
 - The goal list can be a linked list like so
   node{
   	char *user_text;
	int is_completed_flag;
	node *next;
   }



Need to implement:
	Display header/API
	 - Splash welcome
	 - List display
	 - Live editing of goals
		PLAN: Use ncurses


Need to implement:
	Config loader
	 - Obtains values from config file
	 - Implements and initializes a default config
	 - Reassigns default variables based on config
	 	LOW PRIORITY

Need to implement:
	Modeswitch
